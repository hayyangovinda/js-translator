Li mentionner dans Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (Bhāgavata Purāṇa) - Canto
10:
This chapter describes how the marriageable daughters of the
cowherd men worshiped Kātyāyanī to get Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as their
husband, and how Kṛṣṇa stole the garments of the young girls and
gave the girls benedictions.
It is an old system among Indian girls and
women that when they take bath in the river
they place their garments on the bank and
dip into the water completely naked.
Appearing on the scene, Krishna
immediately collected all the garments of
the gopis, climbed up in a nearby tree, and
with smiling face began to speak to them.
"My dear girls," He said. "Please come here
one after another and pray for your garments
and then take them away. I'm not joking with
you. I'm just telling the truth. I have no desire
to play any joke with you, for you have
observed the regulative principles for one month by worshiping
goddess Katyayani. Please do not come here all at once. Come alone;
I want to see each of you in your complete beauty, for you all have
thin waists. I have requested you to come alone. Now please
comply."
When the gopis saw that Krishna was strong and determined, they had
no alternative but to abide by His order. One after another they came
out of the water, but because they were completely naked, they tried
to cover their nakedness by placing their left hand over their
pubic area. In that posture they were all shivering.
The girls, trembling from the cold, climbed out of the water with
their two hands covering their private parts. Kṛṣṇa, who felt great
affection for them, again spoke: “… to counteract it you should offer
obeisances while placing your joined palms above your heads.
Then you should take back your lower garments.
… the gopīs had been thoroughly cheated, deprived of their
modesty, ridiculed and made to act just like toy dolls, and
although their clothing had been stolen, …
